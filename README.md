# Dual_Quaternion_Path_Planning_for_-a_-UR10_Manipulator
This project gets the inverse kinematics (joint space) for a UR10 manipulator, based on a group of cartesian coordinates in the cartesian space. The cartesian coordinates are gotten by using a dual quaternion interpolation, or also known as Sclerp (Screw Linear Interpolation).
